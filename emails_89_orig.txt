Subject: Defective Product Return
Dear Customer Support,
I hope this email finds you well. I recently purchased one of your products, the smart watch GT-65 , but unfortunately, it arrived in a defective condition. I would like to initiate a return and request a refund or replacement.
The issue with the widget is that the power button does not respond consistently, rendering the product unusable. I have tried multiple troubleshooting steps without success. It seems to be a manufacturing defect.
Could you please guide me through the return process? I have attached the purchase receipt and product images as evidence of the defect. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a resolution.
Thank you for your assistance.
Best regards,
Matthew Turner
