Dear John,
I hope this email finds you well. I am delighted to extend an invitation to you for the launch event of launching our latest product innovation, the new smart antivirus. As a valued customer and supporter of our brand, we would be honored to have you join us for this special occasion.
The Product Launch Event will take place on 15 April at Pine Hills Terrace, Tegara, Indonesia. It will be an evening filled with excitement, live demonstrations, and the opportunity to be among the first to experience our new product firsthand. You will also have the chance to network with industry professionals, key stakeholders, and fellow enthusiasts.
We have planned an engaging program that includes presentations from our product development team, interactive showcases, and a reception with refreshments. Additionally, there will be exclusive offers and giveaways available to attendees.
Please find attached the official invitation with all the event details. Kindly RSVP by 3 April to confirm your attendance. As we have limited seating available, we encourage you to secure your spot at your earliest convenience.
We are thrilled to share this milestone with our valued customers like you, and we look forward to your presence at the Product Launch Event. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact our event coordinator, Michael Kim, at michael.kim@outlook.com.
