Subject: Invitation to Guest Lecture
Dear Dr. Wilson,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Robert Mitchell, and I am a faculty member at Voonix University. I am writing to extend an invitation for you to deliver a guest lecture to our students.
Your extensive research and expertise in the field of data science have made a significant impact in the academic community. As we strive to provide our students with exposure to leading professionals, we believe that your insights and knowledge would greatly benefit them.
The guest lecture would typically last around 60 minutes, including a presentation and a question-and-answer session. It can cover topics such as your recent research findings, industry trends, or career advice for aspiring professionals in your field.
We can accommodate a date and time that is most convenient for you. Our students are eager to learn from distinguished scholars like yourself, and we are confident
Best regards,
Robert Mitchell
