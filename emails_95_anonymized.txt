Dear Customer Service Team,
We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to inform you about an upcoming change in our payment processing system that will affect the way payments are made to your company.
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our financial operations, we will be transitioning to a new payment processing system, effective 5 July. This system upgrade will streamline the payment process, improve security measures, and provide a more efficient and reliable experience for both our customers and vendors.
During the transition period, there may be a temporary disruption in payment processing. We assure you that we are taking all necessary measures to minimize any inconvenience and ensure a smooth transition. However, we kindly request your understanding and cooperation during this time.
To facilitate a seamless transition, we will be reaching out to you shortly with detailed instructions and any necessary updates to our payment procedures. Our finance team will be available to address any questions or concerns you may have throughout the process.
We value our business partnership with your Vertay store and appreciate your support and cooperation during this transition. We are confident that the new payment processing system will bring added convenience and efficiency to our financial interactions.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any immediate questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact our finance department at finance@nexily.com.
Best regards,
Jacob Smith
